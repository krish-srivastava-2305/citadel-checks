## Introduction

The Citadel Recommendation System is an advanced machine learning-powered platform designed to deliver highly personalized content recommendations in real-time. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering approaches, this system leverages the power of semantic vector embeddings to understand the deeper meaning and context of user preferences and content characteristics.

### Key Features

- **Semantic Understanding**: Uses advanced NLP models like SBERT to generate meaningful vector representations
- **Real-time Processing**: Event-driven architecture ensures immediate response to user interactions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built to handle millions of users and content items efficiently
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improves recommendations based on user feedback and behavior
- **Multi-modal Support**: Can handle various content types including text, metadata, and user profiles

### System Architecture Overview

The system consists of three main architectural components:

1. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Converts user data and content into semantic vector embeddings
2. **Real-time Recommendation Engine**: Processes user requests and generates personalized recommendations
3. **Event-Driven Update System**: Maintains system state and updates recommendations based on user interactions

## Core Logic

### 1. Vector Embedding Generation

The system transforms user profiles and content into high-dimensional vector representations using state-of-the-art embedding models:

```
UserData → Generate_Chunk_Text → Vector_Embeddings → Pinecone_Database
```

**Chunk Text Generation Process:**
- Combines user demographics, interests, behavior patterns, and bio information
- Creates a coherent natural language representation of user profile
- Optimizes text for embedding model input requirements

**Vector Embedding Process:**
- Utilizes SBERT (Sentence-BERT) or similar transformer models
- Generates 1D numerical vectors (typically 384-768 dimensions)
- Captures semantic meaning and contextual relationships
- Enables similarity-based matching through vector mathematics

### 2. Recommendation Engine Workflow

```
User_Request → Pinecone_Index_Search → Rerank_Algorithm → Top_K_Results
```
![Search FLow](/architecture/SearchFlow.png)
**Event Processing:**
- Triggers when user requests recommendations or ≤5 recommendations remain
- Processes user context including location (city) and preference filters
- Maintains session state and recommendation history

**Search and Ranking:**
- **Initial Search**: Pinecone performs approximate nearest neighbor search using vector similarity
- **Reranking**: Advanced algorithms enhance result diversity and relevance
- **Result Optimization**: Returns top K results with improved diversity metrics

### 3. Real-time Update Mechanism

```
Backend_Events → Message_Broker → Recommendation_Server → Vector_Database_Update
```

**Event-Driven Updates:**
- Publishes update events for user interactions (≥10 updates trigger batch processing)
- Publishes recommendation events for real-time delivery
- Maintains cache consistency through Redis integration

**Continuous Learning:**
- Updates user embeddings based on interaction patterns
- Adjusts recommendation weights based on feedback
- Implements online learning for system improvement
